# Overview 
This repository contains my notes and assignments on model predictive control (MPC) from my Optimal Control course at the University of Pretoria.

I suggest first reading the notes in the _MPC Notes_ folder. 

Thereafter, read through my reports: 
- _1 Unconstrained MPC/Report/Assignment5_Charl.pdf_ 
- _2 Constrained MPC/Report/Assignment7_Charl_Corrected.pdf_

Finally, the MATLAB projects should provide a good starting point for any new MPC simulation: 
- _1 Unconstrained MPC/MATLAB_
- _2 Constrained MPC/MATLAB_
